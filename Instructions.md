# Markdown

- Repository name: `markdown-challenge`
- Mode: `solo`, and as a class
- Type of Challenge: `learning`
- Duration: `Â½ day`

## Learning Objectives

MarkDown is used by developers as a way of quickly writing documentation.
If the convention for titles, text, ... is followed, styling can be easily applied by other tools.
Time to get our hands dirty and give it a try ourselves!

At the end of this challenge you should be able to:

- Write structured content using the _Markdown_ syntax
- Write a README file in Markdown, and push it to GitHub

Remember: write **Markdown**, and _not_ **HTML**

## The Mission

For this exercise, you will create a personal profile page in Markdown, and push it to GitHub. All your profile pages will be linked one to the other, so that you have a comprehensive list of people for the whole class.

## Instructions

### Phase 1

1. Fill the README with the following content:

> Your Name (as a large header)
>
> An inspirational quote in _italics_
>
> A (professional) photo of yourself (you can save the file in the repository next to the README file)
>
> "Me, in one sentence" (as a smaller header)
>
> A table with the following structure:
>
> ---
>
> Birthday: dd/mm  
> Favorite color: ?  
> Favorite food: ?  
> Pinneapple on pizza: Yes/No (Extra challenge: make it look like a (un)checked checkbox)
>
> ---
>
> Hobbies (smaller header)
>
> _This should contain a bullet list of your hobbies_  
> _At least on item should contain a sublist, for example if you like movies, maybe make a sublist of some movies you really like._
>
> You can always count on me when... (smaller header)
>
> _Tell your teammates which positive contribution to the group you will make._  
> _This could be technical, making people feel comfortable, being an organiser..._
>
> A funny story (smaller header)
>
> _Tell a short funny story about your life._
>
> TL;DR (even smaller header, under funny story)
>
> _Summarise your funny story in one short sentence._

### Phase 2

> First, check you have git installed first

1. Create a repository called `markdown-challenge` on GitHub
2. Clone the repository locally on your computer (I suggest you place this repository - and the future ones - inside a folder called `BeCode`)
3. `add` your file to the repository, `commit` it, and `push` the changes

Now, add some extra content to your page:

> ! IMPORTANT -> At the bottom of the page there should be a next and previous link, this should link to the page of the previous student (alphabetically) and the next one.  
> Organise yourself so it is easy to know who you should link to.
>
> The links should have the following structure:
>
> << previous || YOUR NAME || next >>
